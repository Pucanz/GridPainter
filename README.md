# ðŸŽ¨ Grid Painter ðŸŽ¨

Grid Painter is a Java project developed during the 5th week of my Java bootcamp.
The game consists of an interactive grid where you can paint squares, remove the paint, and save or load your progress to continue later.
It allows users to have full control over the grid and the painting, offering a creative and customizable experience.
